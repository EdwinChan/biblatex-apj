Probably the first `biblatex` style compatible with the citation and
bibliography style of the Astrophysical Journal. Examples of this style in use
can be found at https://arxiv.org/a/0000-0001-5949-6109.

To make the dashes for repeated authors longer, add
`\setlength\bibhang{1.25em}` before `\printbibliography`.
